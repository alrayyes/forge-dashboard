# Deployment

Deployed on a homelab, reachable only over Tailscale. Passkey login is
now the actual access control — the tailnet is defence in depth on top
of it, not the only thing standing between a visitor and the dashboard
the way v1 originally had it. The image is pulled into that homelab's
existing compose setup as its own service directory, routed through the
Traefik instance already running there; there's no per-service Tailscale
sidecar, since every service on that host reaches the tailnet the same
way. That deployment config — including the `/data` volume this now
needs, and `RP_ID`/`RP_ORIGIN` set to the real deployed domain rather
than the `localhost` defaults — lives in that private deployment repo,
not here.
