# Running it

```sh
go build -o forge-dashboard ./cmd/forge-dashboard
mkdir -p data
DB_PATH=./data/forge-dashboard.db \
  ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  ./forge-dashboard
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`, register a passkey — `RP_ID`/
`RP_ORIGIN` default to `localhost`/`http://localhost:8080`, which matches
this local run with nothing extra to set — and add your GitHub/Forgejo
credentials from the Settings page.

## Docker

The `/data` directory the image ships is where the database goes — mount
a volume there, or every passkey and every saved credential is gone the
moment the container is recreated:

```sh
docker build -t forge-dashboard .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  --cap-drop=ALL --security-opt=no-new-privileges --read-only \
  --memory=64m --cpus=0.5 --pids-limit=64 \
  -v forge-dashboard-data:/data \
  -e RP_ID=localhost -e RP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080 \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  forge-dashboard
```

The image carries a `HEALTHCHECK` that runs `/forge-dashboard healthcheck`,
which asks `GET /readyz`. It means "can serve": the database answers and its
tables exist. Once someone has signed in and a first dashboard refresh has
finished, it also waits on that, and a forge that failed the refresh still
counts. A freshly started container has no refresh to wait for, since the
app only fetches from the forges after a sign-in. The database ping gets 2
seconds and its result is reused for about 3, so a stuck database answers
503 instead of hanging the probe. On SIGTERM it answers 503 at once, then
the server waits `SHUTDOWN_DRAIN` before it stops. A 200 also reports the
`goroutines` and OS `threads` the process holds. The container's process limit
counts threads, so watch `threads` to see growth before the healthcheck can no
longer start. A 50-repo refresh from six tabs peaks at about 20 threads, so
`--pids-limit=64` leaves room. Read it with:

```sh
docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' <container>
```

`starting` is normal for up to 30 seconds after boot, then `healthy`. A
healthy container stays healthy when a forge goes unreachable. That shows
on the dashboard, not here. `GET /healthz` stays the cheap liveness answer
(the process is up). In Compose, `depends_on` with
`condition: service_healthy` waits on the same state.

Generate `ENCRYPTION_KEY` once and keep it — losing it makes every saved
credential unrecoverable, and every user has to re-enter theirs from the
Settings page.

The published image is `ghcr.io/alrayyes/forge-dashboard`, built and
pushed on every release by `.goreleaser.yml`'s `dockers:` block — tagged
by version and `:latest`, `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
